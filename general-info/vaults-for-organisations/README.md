# SAFE with Enzyme

This section explores how to create Enzyme products with organisations using Safe.

## What is Safe?

Safe is a multisig wallet which allows organisations to customize how they manage their crypto assets, with the option to require a predefined number of signatures to confirm transactions before they are executed. This helps prevent unauthorized access to organisation-owned crypto.

## **Why Safe + Enzyme?** <a href="#b545" id="b545"></a>

You might be asking yourself why would anyone want to use a multisig to manage assets with Enzyme? Here are a few reasons:

* Organisations can delegate trading to 3rd-party for efficiency whilst setting roles, permissions & stop losses. These are enforced by smart-contract code.
* Organisations are able to access a quick & easy way to connect to multiple DeFi protocols from the luxury of one simple, unified DeFi interface.
* Enzyme provides users with full, easily readable, auditable and transparent reporting over assets being managed.
* Organisations can invite 3rd party depositors to deposit alongside their strategies and charge optional fees (eg management, performance, entrance all calculated and distributed in an automated way).
* Safe gives Vault managers a way to layer organisational governance structures on top of their products.

Some interesting use-cases:

### **1. DAO Treasury Management** <a href="#id-89e1" id="id-89e1"></a>

DAOs often sit on large treasuries which are not being actively managed. It can be challenging to manage a DAO treasury efficiently and track its performance transparently. This is a perfect use-case for Safe + Enzyme. Organisations can simply plug their Safe into Enzyme and engage with a purpose-built asset management toolkit.

### 2. Fund Administrator

A fund administrator wants to accomodate for on-chain funds. Being able to set up an Enzyme vault with embedded roles and permissions offers a lot of benefits to them and can ensure fund security. More on this use-case [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M17sAWG26bbHj7WurKa/s/WzXrybpj5e9VBbPlbYCJ/).

### 3. Crypto Investment Clubs

Investment clubs are groups of individuals who join together to invest together and share resources. In many countries they also benefit from regulatory exemptions. Members of such clubs typically meet on a periodic basis to make investment decisions as a group through a voting process and recording of minutes, or gather information and perform investment transactions. A combination of Safe + Enzyme enables you to set one of these up in minutes!

### **4. Eliminating Operational Risk** <a href="#id-5068" id="id-5068"></a>

In general, nobody likes operational risk — especially organisations. If a Vault Manager were to compromise his/her private key or become incapacitated there is a question over what happens to the future of their assets. By having a multisig, you can drastically reduce these kinds of operational risks.

The possibilities are endless, those are just a few common use cases of a multisig on Enzyme.
